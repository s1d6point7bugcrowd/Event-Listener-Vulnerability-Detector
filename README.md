# Event Listener Vulnerability Detector

This project is a tool to detect potential vulnerabilities in web applications related to the use of event listeners. It scans HTML and JavaScript content for unsafe use of `eval`, adding event listeners with unsanitized user input, and potential memory leaks due to missing `removeEventListener` calls.

## Features

- Detects unsafe use of `eval`.
- Identifies event listeners added with unsanitized user input.
- Detects potential memory leaks due to `addEventListener` without corresponding `removeEventListener`.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/event-listener-vuln-detector.git
    cd event-listener-vuln-detector
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install axios jsdom
    ```

## Usage

To analyze a URL for event listener vulnerabilities, run the following command:

```bash
node detectEventListenerVulns.js <url>
